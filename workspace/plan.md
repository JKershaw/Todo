## Major Accomplishments âœ…

### Focus Flow Interface Breakthrough
The core revolutionary UX has been achieved - the seamless connection between immediate Level 0 actions and larger life goals through intelligent visual design. This was the primary vision from the original brief.

### System Completion Status
- **95% of original vision complete**
- Web dashboard with real-time WebSocket monitoring
- Graceful server management with clean shutdown
- Level 0 task extraction API working
- All core commands implemented (init, status, save, zoom, reflect, project)
- Comprehensive test suite (29+ tests passing)
- Self-managing development workflow established

## Current Priorities

1. **AI Task Relationship Mapping**: Implement intelligent suggestions for task coordination
2. **Dashboard Integration**: Complete task completion flow from web interface to files  
3. **Momentum Visualization**: Add progress indicators and completion tracking
4. **Performance**: Optimize for larger workspaces and multiple projects

## Technical Notes

The system successfully demonstrates recursive development - managing its own improvement using its own productivity framework. The Focus Flow Interface delivers the core experience: "What should I do right now?" with progressive zoom-out to larger goals.

Next phase focuses on intelligent AI coordination to complete the vision of treating productivity as a dynamic, living system rather than static lists.
