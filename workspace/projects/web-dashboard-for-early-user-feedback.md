# Project: Web Dashboard for Early User Feedback

**Status:** 85% Complete - Near Production Ready  
**Level:** 2  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core functionality achieved, focusing on final AI integration

## Goal
Create a browser-based dashboard that allows users to watch their productivity system work in real-time, providing early feedback on the intended user experience and interface design according to the original project brief.

## Level 4 Connection (Life Goal)
Enable users to experience the system's intelligence visually, making productivity patterns tangible and providing immediate feedback for system evolution.

## Why This Matters (User Request)
- **Early Validation**: Experience the system as it's intended to work

### Frontend Features
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live data
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, minimal interface
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic viewing
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Fast loading, efficient updates

### Integration Points
- **CLI Commands**: Dashboard updates when user runs `prod` commands
- **File Changes**: Automatically refresh when workspace files change
- **AI Responses**: Show AI analysis and suggestions visually
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual representation of task completion

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Watching**: Sit back and watch productivity system work
2. **Browsing**: Explore projects and progress visually  
3. **Monitoring**: Keep dashboard open while working on other tasks
4. **Feedback**: Provide input on interface and user experience

### Success Metrics
- [ ] **Engagement Time**: Users spend >5 minutes exploring dashboard
- [ ] **Feedback Quality**: Receive actionable UX feedback within first week  
- [ ] **Visual Clarity**: Users understand productivity data without explanation
- [ ] **Real-time Responsiveness**: Updates appear within 1 second of CLI commands

## Original Brief Integration
*[User to add original brief here for dashboard alignment]*

The web dashboard should reflect the original vision and allow testing of:
- User interaction patterns described in brief
- Visual design philosophy 
- Information architecture priorities
- Workflow assumptions

## Feedback Collection Strategy

### Methods
- [ ] **In-Dashboard Feedback**: Simple rating and comment system
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**: Track most/least used features
- [ ] **User Interviews**: Schedule feedback sessions with early users
- [ ] **A/B Testing**: Test different interface approaches

### Questions to Answer
- Does the visual representation match your mental model?
- Which information is most/least important to see?
- How does the real-time updating feel?
- What would make this more useful for daily productivity?

## Remaining Work (15% - Estimated 15-21 hours)

### Critical Remaining Tasks
- [ ] **Real AI Integration**: Replace mock AI responses with actual Claude API calls
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Add comprehensive test suite for web dashboard components  
- [ ] **Production Configuration**: Environment configs, deployment scripts, optimization

## Notes

This project represents a significant shift in development priorities based on user feedback. By moving the web dashboard from Phase 3 to Phase 1, we can:

1. **Validate Early**: Test the visual interface against the original brief
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Get user feedback before building advanced features  
3. **Experience the Vision**: See the productivity system as it's meant to be experienced
4. **Guide Development**: Use real user feedback to shape future features

The dashboard should be minimal but engaging - a window into the productivity system that makes the abstract concept of "productivity tracking" tangible and visual.
