# Project: Web Dashboard for Early User Feedback

**Status:** Active  
**Level:** 2  
**Started:** 2025-07-19  
**Target:** 2025-08-15  
**Priority:** HIGH - Moved from Phase 3 to Phase 1 for early validation

## Goal
Create a browser-based dashboard that allows users to watch their productivity system work in real-time, providing early feedback on the intended user experience and interface design according to the original project brief.

## Level 4 Connection (Life Goal)
Enable users to experience the system's intelligence visually, making productivity patterns tangible and providing immediate feedback for system evolution.

## Why This Matters (User Request)
- **Early Validation**: Experience the system as it's intended to work
- **Visual Feedback**: Watch the system operate instead of just command-line interactions
- **Iterative Design**: Gather user feedback to shape the final interface
- **Original Brief Alignment**: Test against the original vision before advanced features

## Level 3 Milestones (Next Month)
- [ ] **MVP Dashboard Deployed** (Week 1): Basic live-updating interface  
- [ ] **Real-time Visualization** (Week 2): Watch system operations happen
- [ ] **User Feedback Integration** (Week 3): Collect and analyze user experience
- [ ] **Iteration Based on Feedback** (Week 4): Improve based on real usage

- [ ] **Feedback Collection**: Easy ways to provide UX feedback
- [ ] **Original Brief Testing**: Validate against original vision
- [ ] **Interaction Patterns**: Test different ways of browsing productivity data

## Level 1 Tasks (This Week)

### Setup & Foundation  
- [ ] **Project Structure**: Create web dashboard directory structure
- [ ] **Basic Express Server**: Set up web server with static file serving
- [ ] **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time communication between CLI and web
- [ ] **Basic HTML/CSS**: Clean, minimal interface matching productivity philosophy
- [ ] **File System Monitoring**: Watch workspace files for changes

### Initial Features
- [ ] **Live README Display**: Show current workspace README in browser
- [ ] **Project List View**: Display all projects with progress bars  
- [ ] **Recent Activity**: Show last 10 productivity commands executed
- [ ] **System Status**: Live display of workspace health
- [ ] **Basic Navigation**: Switch between different views

### User Feedback Preparation
- [ ] **Feedback Form**: Simple way to collect user experience feedback
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**: Track which features are most/least engaging
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure dashboard is fast and responsive

## Level 0 Actions (Next 15 minutes)

### Immediate Setup
- [ ] Create `web-dashboard/` directory in project root
- [ ] Set up basic Express.js project structure  
- [ ] Create initial HTML template with productivity system branding
- [ ] Test basic web server startup and file serving

### Quick Wins
- [ ] Display current workspace README as live webpage
- [ ] Show list of projects from projects/ directory
- [ ] Add basic CSS for clean, readable interface
- [ ] Test on mobile device for responsive design

### Frontend Features
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live data
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, minimal interface
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic viewing
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Fast loading, efficient updates

### Integration Points
- **CLI Commands**: Dashboard updates when user runs `prod` commands
- **File Changes**: Automatically refresh when workspace files change
- **AI Responses**: Show AI analysis and suggestions visually
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual representation of task completion

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Watching**: Sit back and watch productivity system work
2. **Browsing**: Explore projects and progress visually  
3. **Monitoring**: Keep dashboard open while working on other tasks
4. **Feedback**: Provide input on interface and user experience

### Success Metrics
- [ ] **Engagement Time**: Users spend >5 minutes exploring dashboard
- [ ] **Feedback Quality**: Receive actionable UX feedback within first week  
- [ ] **Visual Clarity**: Users understand productivity data without explanation
- [ ] **Real-time Responsiveness**: Updates appear within 1 second of CLI commands

## Original Brief Integration
*[User to add original brief here for dashboard alignment]*

The web dashboard should reflect the original vision and allow testing of:
- User interaction patterns described in brief
- Visual design philosophy 
- Information architecture priorities
- Workflow assumptions

## Feedback Collection Strategy

### Methods
- [ ] **In-Dashboard Feedback**: Simple rating and comment system
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**: Track most/least used features
- [ ] **User Interviews**: Schedule feedback sessions with early users
- [ ] **A/B Testing**: Test different interface approaches

### Questions to Answer
- Does the visual representation match your mental model?
- Which information is most/least important to see?
- How does the real-time updating feel?
- What would make this more useful for daily productivity?

## Completed
- [x] Project created and prioritized in roadmap
- [x] User feedback request incorporated
- [x] Technical architecture planned

## Notes

This project represents a significant shift in development priorities based on user feedback. By moving the web dashboard from Phase 3 to Phase 1, we can:

1. **Validate Early**: Test the visual interface against the original brief
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Get user feedback before building advanced features  
3. **Experience the Vision**: See the productivity system as it's meant to be experienced
4. **Guide Development**: Use real user feedback to shape future features

The dashboard should be minimal but engaging - a window into the productivity system that makes the abstract concept of "productivity tracking" tangible and visual.
