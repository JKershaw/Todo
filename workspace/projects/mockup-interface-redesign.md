# Project: Focus Flow Interface Redesign (Mockup Implementation)

**Status:** Active  
**Level:** 2  
**Started:** 2025-07-19  
**Target:** 2025-07-26  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core UX Implementation

## Goal
Redesign the Focus Flow web dashboard to match the original mockup vision with three-mode interface (Do/Plan/Reflect), glassmorphism styling, momentum visualization, and conversational AI chat.

## Level 4 Connection (Life Goal)
Complete the original productivity system vision - transforming from basic task management to an intelligent, visually beautiful system that connects immediate actions to life goals.

## Key Mockup Features to Implement
1. **Three-Mode Interface**: Do (immediate tasks), Plan (hierarchical goals), Reflect (momentum & insights)
2. **Glassmorphism Design**: Backdrop-filter blur effects, translucent cards, gradient backgrounds
3. **Mobile-First Design**: 480px max-width, responsive typography, touch-friendly interactions
4. **Momentum Visualization**: Progress bars showing advancement toward different life areas
5. **Conversational AI Chat**: Context-aware suggestions with message bubbles
6. **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects, click-to-complete transitions, message slide-ins

## Level 3 Milestones (This Week)
- [ ] **Visual Redesign Complete**: New glassmorphism styling implemented
- [ ] **Three-Mode Interface**: Do/Plan/Reflect mode switching functional
- [ ] **Momentum System**: Progress bars and insights from task completion patterns
- [ ] **AI Chat Integration**: Conversational interface with context-aware responses

## Level 2 Tasks (Current Sprint)

### Core Interface Restructure
- [ ] Implement three-mode switcher (Do/Plan/Reflect)
- [ ] Redesign task cards with glassmorphism styling
- [ ] Add mobile-first responsive layout (480px container)
- [ ] Implement gradient background with backdrop filters

### Do Mode (Immediate Tasks)
- [ ] Clean task list view with time estimates
- [ ] Context subtitles (energy, weather, urgency indicators)
- [ ] Click-to-complete with smooth animations
- [ ] Auto-refresh when tasks completed

### Plan Mode (Hierarchical Goals)
- [ ] Goal sections with emoji headers
- [ ] Task hierarchy showing connections (Today → Week → Quarter → Life)
- [ ] Visual indentation for task levels
- [ ] Clear goal-to-action relationships

### Reflect Mode (Momentum & Insights)
- [ ] Progress bars for different life areas
- [ ] Momentum calculations based on completed tasks
- [ ] AI-generated insights about patterns and cross-goal relationships
- [ ] Energy pattern analysis and seasonal adjustments

### Conversational AI Chat
- [ ] Chat interface with message bubbles
- [ ] Context-aware AI responses based on current tasks and progress
- [ ] Integration with existing AI service for intelligent suggestions
- [ ] Message history and conversation continuity

## Level 1 Tasks (This Week)

### Design System Implementation
- [ ] Update CSS with glassmorphism variables and utilities
- [ ] Implement gradient backgrounds and blur effects
- [ ] Add smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Create responsive typography scale

### Backend Integration
- [ ] Add momentum calculation API endpoint
- [ ] Enhance focus-flow API to support three modes
- [ ] Add progress tracking across different life areas
- [ ] Integrate chat with existing AI service

### User Experience Polish
- [ ] Add loading states and micro-interactions
- [ ] Implement smooth mode transitions
- [ ] Add context-aware task subtitles
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

## Level 0 Actions (Next 15 minutes)

### Immediate Setup
- [ ] **START HERE**: Copy mockup HTML/CSS as reference template
- [ ] Create new branch for interface redesign
- [ ] Backup current dashboard styles
- [ ] Set up development environment for rapid iteration

### Quick Wins  
- [ ] Replace current gradient background with mockup version
- [ ] Update container max-width to 480px
- [ ] Add glassmorphism card styling to existing tasks
- [ ] Test three-mode button switcher

### New API Endpoints
- `GET /api/momentum` - Progress bars and insights
- `POST /api/chat` - Conversational AI responses
- `GET /api/plan-view` - Hierarchical goal structure
- `GET /api/reflect-data` - Pattern analysis and insights

## Success Criteria
- [ ] **Visual Fidelity**: Dashboard matches mockup design aesthetics
- [ ] **Three-Mode Functionality**: Smooth switching between Do/Plan/Reflect
- [ ] **Momentum Visualization**: Progress bars accurately reflect task completion patterns
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Perfect experience on 480px and mobile devices
- [ ] **AI Chat Integration**: Context-aware conversations about productivity
- [ ] **Performance**: <200ms response time, smooth 60fps animations

## Original Mockup Integration Points
- **Do Mode**: Matches "Do" tab - clean task list with time estimates and context
- **Plan Mode**: Matches "Plan" tab - hierarchical goal structure with clear connections  
- **Reflect Mode**: Matches "Reflect" tab - momentum bars and cross-goal insights
- **Chat Interface**: Bottom chat section with AI conversation
- **Visual Style**: Exact glassmorphism styling, gradients, and animations
