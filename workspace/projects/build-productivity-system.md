# Project: Build Productivity System

**Status:** Active  
**Level:** 2  
**Started:** 2025-07-19  
**Target:** 2025-08-18  

## Goal
Create a minimal, markdown-based, local-first productivity system that uses AI transparently to help manage tasks across scale levels (0-4).

## Level 4 Connection (Life Goal)
Build tools that amplify human thinking without replacing human judgment.

## Level 3 Milestones (Quarterly)
- [ ] Core system functional (Week 1)
- [ ] Recursive development workflow (Week 2)  
- [ ] Daily use validated (Week 4)

## Level 2 Projects (Current Sprint)
- [x] Design system philosophy and file structure
- [x] Implement core commands (init, status, save, zoom)
- [x] Set up GitHub repository and version control
- [x] Test system by using it to manage its own development
- [ ] Implement reflect command for guided reflection
- [ ] Implement project management commands
- [ ] Add habit tracking capabilities
- [ ] Improve reflection algorithms

## Level 1 Tasks (This Week)
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Implement init command with templates  
- [x] Implement status command with AI integration
- [x] Test basic workflow with real tasks
- [x] Start recursive development pattern
- [x] Create GitHub repository and push initial version
- [ ] Implement reflect command
- [ ] Add project lifecycle management

## Level 0 Actions (Next 15 minutes)
- [ ] Test reflect command implementation
- [ ] Test project command implementation  
- [ ] Document usage patterns
- [ ] Plan next enhancement cycle

## Completed
- [x] Define system philosophy
- [x] Design file structure and templates
- [x] Create implementation specification
- [x] Set up TypeScript/Node.js project structure
- [x] Implement core file system utilities
- [x] Create template system with self-bootstrap project
- [x] Build AI service integration (Anthropic + mock)
- [x] Implement init command with workspace creation
- [x] Implement status command with AI analysis
- [x] Implement save command with progress tracking
- [x] Implement zoom command for scale navigation
- [x] Add comprehensive test suite (11 tests passing)
- [x] Create complete documentation and README
- [x] Set up GitHub repository with proper .gitignore
- [x] Create system workspace for self-management

## Notes
This project demonstrates the system managing its own development - the ultimate dogfooding test.
